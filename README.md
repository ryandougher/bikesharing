# Citibike Bikesharing Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to analyze existing bikeshare data from New York City, in order to evaluate the potential investment into a new bikeshare company in Des Moines, Iowa. Tableau was used to create visualizations on the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, the number of bike trips for all riders and genders, and the number of bike trips for each user type and gender.

## Results

This visual shows the most popular start times for the month of august, as well as the most populat starting locations. There is a peak of rides in the morning at 8am and in the afternoon at 5-6pm. The most popular start locations are also the most popular tourist spots.

The second visual shows the trip duration for all riders, as well as by gender. For all riders, most rides take 4-6 hours. Broken down by gender, the ride duration stays about the same. There are far more male riders than female.

The third visual shows the amount of trips by weekday per hour, and then is also broken down by user type. On Monday through Friday, 8am and 5-6pm are hot spots, suggesting many riders are commuting to and from work. Riders on the weekends are more spread out from 10am-6pm.

The final visual shows ride startime by weekday per hour, broken down by gender. The patterns for male and female riders are similar, with more riders being male.

## Summary

Using the data from New York, we can uncover key insights for a potential bikeshare business in Des Moines. Most rides were located in Manhattan Island. During the week, most rides were taken during rush hours, likely by commuters. Also, the far majority of riders were males.

This analysis could be built on by looking at data for more months of the year, and by including weather data to find any correlations.
